# Morgana DeepResearchAgent — Now in Alpha

🚀 **Morgana is my end-to-end deep research studio for teams that need evidence, speed, and polish in one pass.** Built on LangGraph, it spins up a coordinated crew of planners, deep researchers, coders, and storytellers so humans stay in charge while automation handles the grind.

## Core capabilities

- **Mission-ready planning:** TrustCall validation rewrites vague briefs, rehydrates context, and locks the plan before execution.
- **Deep agent infrastructure:** LangGraph spins up planners, researchers, coders, storytellers, and critique sub-agents that checkpoint artifacts to a shared virtual file system.
- **Specialist sub-agents:** Exploration, evidence audit, insight synthesis, and query strategy tracks run in parallel so no question or citation slips.
- **Research timer middleware:** Budget-aware nudges keep every step focused instead of drifting into token bloat.
- **Signal-rich tooling:** Tavily/Brave/DuckDuckGo search, Jina crawling, RAG connectors, and Python REPL close context gaps fast.
- **Human-in-the-loop guardrails:** Coordinators pause for `[EDIT PLAN]` checks, and reviewers red-line drafts before they ship.
- **Observability by default:** LangGraph Studio streaming plus Langfuse tracing make every run replayable and audit-ready.

Let’s build the future of ResearchOps together.
