    "You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\n",

    "To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\n",
    "1/ intro\n",

    "3/ overview of topic B\n",
    "4/ comparison between A and B\n",
    "5/ conclusion\n",

    "To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\n",
    "1/ list of things or table of things\n",
    "Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.\n",
    "1/ item 1\n",
    "2/ item 2\n",
    "3/ item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\n",
    "1/ overview of topic\n",
    "2/ concept 1\n",
    "3/ concept 2\n",

    "For each section of the report, do the following:\n",
    "- Use simple, clear language\n",
    "- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\n",
    "- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \n",
    "- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\n",
    "- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\n",

       "  ToolMessage(content='The report `final_report.md` provides a comprehensive and well-structured analysis of Agentech, an insurance claims startup. It effectively addresses all five questions posed in `question.txt` with a good level of detail and supporting evidence.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed critique focusing on clarity, comprehensiveness, accuracy, adherence to format, and actionable feedback for improvement:\\n\\n### Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe report is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, is well-researched, and presents information clearly and professionally. The use of headings, a text-heavy format supplemented by bullet points, and consistent citations significantly contribute to its quality and credibility. All five original questions have been answered thoroughly.\\n\\n### Section-by-Section Critique\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Structure:**\\n    *   **Appropriate Naming:** All section headings (\"Introduction,\" \"Founders of Agentech,\" \"Funding Status of Agentech,\" \"Recent News Articles about Agentech,\" \"Competitors of Agentech,\" \"Recent Job Postings for Agentech,\" \"Sources\") are clear, descriptive, and directly relevant to the content within each section.\\n    *   **Text-Heavy Format:** The report successfully maintains an essay-like, text-heavy style. Bullet points are used judiciously within sections (e.g., for listing founders, funding details, news items, and competitors), which enhances readability without making the report feel like a mere list. Each bullet point is properly contextualized by surrounding paragraphs.\\n    *   **Fluent Language:** The language used is professional, clear, and easy to understand, contributing to a smooth reading experience.\\n\\n2.  **Comprehensiveness and Detail:**\\n    *   **Founders of Agentech:** This section is highly comprehensive, providing not only the names and roles of the founders but also detailed backgrounds, including their previous successful ventures and acquisition values. This depth offers valuable insight into their expertise and track record.\\n    *   **Funding Status of Agentech:** This section is exceptionally detailed, outlining the seed round amount, date, key investors, ownership status, and even participation in the NVIDIA Inception Program, including the benefits derived from it. This provides a complete picture of their financial standing and strategic partnerships.\\n    *   **Recent News Articles about Agentech:** This section is thorough, listing several significant news events with specific dates where available. The summaries of each article highlight Agentech\\'s innovative approach, partnerships, and public perception, demonstrating a deep dive into recent coverage.\\n    *   **Competitors of Agentech:** This section goes beyond simply listing competitors by also mentioning the total number of active competitors and distinguishing between direct and indirect competitors/partners. The inclusion of Snapsheet as both a competitor and a partner adds a nuanced understanding of the market landscape.\\n    *   **Recent Job Postings for Agentech:** While direct job postings were not immediately found, the report comprehensively addresses the question by explaining this limitation and providing alternative, relevant information from LinkedIn (e.g., recent hires, company size, and general recruitment activity). This demonstrates a thorough effort to answer the question with available data.\\n\\n3.  **Accuracy and Adherence to Topic:**\\n    *   **Accuracy:** The report relies heavily on external sources, with 15 distinct citations, which significantly boosts its credibility and accuracy. The information presented appears well-researched and factual.\\n    *   **Adherence to Topic:** The report closely follows the research topic and directly answers all five questions specified in `question.txt`. There is no deviation from the core subject.\\n    *   **Deep Analysis:** The report provides valuable insights where appropriate. For example, the detailed backgrounds of the founders, the strategic implications of the NVIDIA Inception Program, the \"Minions\" analogy for Agentech\\'s AI, and the distinction between direct and indirect competitors all contribute to a deeper understanding of the company.\\n\\n### Actionable Feedback for Improvement\\n\\nWhile the report is of high quality, here are a few minor suggestions for further enhancement:\\n\\n1.  **Introduction Expansion:** The introduction is concise, which is good. However, a slight expansion could be beneficial to provide a broader context. For instance, briefly mentioning the growing importance of AI in the insurance sector or the emerging tech ecosystem in Oklahoma City could further set the stage for Agentech\\'s role. This would add more background without making the introduction overly long.\\n2.  **Competitors - Unique Value Proposition:** In the \"Competitors of Agentech\" section, while direct competitors are listed, a brief statement about what differentiates Agentech from these top competitors (if information was available during research) would significantly enhance the analysis. For example, a sentence like, \"Unlike [Competitor X] which primarily focuses on [specific niche], Agentech distinguishes itself by [unique feature/approach].\" This would provide readers with a clearer understanding of Agentech\\'s unique selling points in a crowded market.\\n3.  **Job Postings - Future Guidance (Minor):** For the \"Recent Job Postings\" section, while the current explanation is excellent, a small addition advising interested individuals on where to consistently look for future openings (e.g., \"Prospective candidates are encouraged to regularly check Agentech\\'s official LinkedIn page and their company website\\'s \\'Careers\\' or \\'Team\\' section for updated job opportunities.\") could be helpful. The report already mentions these sources, but a direct guidance sentence would make it more actionable for someone looking for employment.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe report on Agentech is well-researched, clearly written, and comprehensive. It successfully fulfills all the requirements of the critique, demonstrating a high standard of editorial quality. The suggested improvements are minor and aim to refine an already strong piece of work.', name='task', id='ce79c12b-97b1-45da-8d4d-5fc6440cae83', tool_call_id='d9d48801-c726-4bf0-b629-091be20b47ff'),\n",
