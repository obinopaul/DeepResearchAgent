# Morgana Research Studio

> Crafted by Paul Okafor for deep, defensible answers.

Morgana is the research workbench I rely on when a question deserves more than a quick search-result skim. It layers orchestrated agents, curated tools, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints so long-form investigations stay accurate, citeable, and aligned with intent.

## What Morgana Delivers

- **Agent choreography** â€“ Supervisor and specialist agents coordinate planning, sourcing, verification, and synthesis.
- **Source-grounded outputs** â€“ Every brief, timeline, and recommendation links back to the evidence that produced it.
- **On-demand guardrails** â€“ Interrupt any run, steer it with new guidance, or accept the plan to keep the loop moving.
- **Shareable artifacts** â€“ Export polished reports or spin up narrated podcasts straight from the research canvas.

## Thanks to the Ecosystem

This studio stands on the shoulders of stellar open source projects:

- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) for reliable agent orchestration.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the front-of-house experience.
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for state management and motion design.

If you ship something with Morgana, Iâ€™d love to hear about it. Letâ€™s keep building tools that make deep thinking easier.
